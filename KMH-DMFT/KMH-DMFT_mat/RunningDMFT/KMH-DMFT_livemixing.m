%% HOW TO USE?
%
%  - Put this script, together with an input-file for your driver in a path
%    > This path will contain directories for all the U values you set-up.
%  - Set-up the name of your driver program (without .f90 extension)
%    > e.g. driver = 'ed_kane_mele';
%  - Adjust Umin, Umax and Ustep to your desire --> U = Umin:Ustep:Umax
%  - Set SOI to your desire: --> you will get a fixed-SOI linear span
%  - Adjust Uold to catch a 'restart-folder' in the path [!applies -> -1]
%  - Adjust notConvThreshold to control how much DMFT will wait for you (!)
%  - Select doMPI (true.or.false) to run with openMPI or not
%  - Run everything with $ matlab -batch RunningDMFT_livemixing
%  - Once in a while control for the presence of ERROR.README in the path
%    > If you see it, DMFT is not converging; you might want to inspect the
%      the output files and update wmixing in the **external** input-file
%      to a suitable value. At the next run DMFT will catch the update ;)
%  - At the end you will find some additional output in the U=%f folders
%    > a LOG_dmft.txt which is just a mirror of the DMFT output (via tee)
%    > a LOG_time.txt which is a wall-clock-time value for the whole DMFT
%  - Also an additional output file in the main (external) path
%    > a U_list.txt that stores all the used U-values (for easier post..)
