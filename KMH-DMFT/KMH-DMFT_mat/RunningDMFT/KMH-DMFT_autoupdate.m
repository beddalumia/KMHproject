%% HOW TO USE?
%
%  - Put this script, together with an input-file for your driver in a path
%    > This path will contain directories for all the U values you set-up.
%  - Set-up the name of your driver program (without .f90 extension)
%    > e.g. driver = 'ed_kane_mele'; 
%  - Set SOI to your desire: --> you will get a fixed-SOI linear span
%  - Adjust Umin and Umax to your desire --> U \in [Umin, Umax]
%  - Adjust Uold to catch a 'restart-folder' in the path [!applies -> -1]
%  - Select doMPI (true.or.false) to run with openMPI or not
%  - Run everything with $ matlab -batch RunningDMFT_autoupdate
%  - At the end you will find some additional output in the U=%f folders
%    > a LOG_dmft.txt which is just a mirror of the DMFT output (via tee)
%    > a LOG_time.txt which is a wall-clock-time value for the whole DMFT
%  - Also a additional output files in the main (external) path
%    > a U_list.txt that stores all the used U-values (for easier post..)
%    > possibly some error-flag files in the format 'ERROR_U=%f'
%      if you see them you *may* have to discard the corresponding folder
%      > check it for convergence! (look at LOG_dmft.txt)
