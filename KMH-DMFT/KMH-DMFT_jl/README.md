# KMH-DMFT_jl
Running QcmPlab DMFT codes from Julia

## TO DO: _julia_-interface to [PhaseMap](https://github.com/greschd/PhaseMap), to enable _even-more_-efficient spans.
- [ ] Thoroughly test the julia API provided by [QcmPlab](https://github.com/QcmPlab).
- [ ] Understand if calling python code from julia could really make everything faster.
- [ ] Understand how to properly use PhaseMap for DMFT calculations, i.e. having it implemented in [KMH-DMFT_py](../KMH-DMFT_py)
- [ ] Understand if and how julia can be loaded as a module in [Ulysses](https://www.itcs.sissa.it/services/computing/hpc) (ðŸ˜…)
