# KMH-DMFT_hpc
Running QcmPlab DMFT codes on SLURM-managed hpc clusters

-------------

Everything is heavily based on the mighty [How to Survive the Mermaids](https://ulysses.readthedocs.io/index.html) unofficial guide to Ulysses (the SISSA hpc facility), with some slight twist based on the alerts reported in the [official-but-hyperconcise guide to Ulysses](https://www.itcs.sissa.it/services/computing/hpc), provided by ITCS.
