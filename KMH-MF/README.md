--------

- [KMH-MF_f90](./KMH-MF_f90) contains the main fortran program, together with an appropriate makefile

- [KMH-MF_mat](./KMH-MF_mat) collects some `MATLAB` scripts, providing a basic workflow for transition lines and phase diagrams.

- [KMH-MF_f2py](./KMH-MF_f2py) provides an interface to the `Python` package [PhaseMap](https://github.com/greschd/PhaseMap), allowing for a smart&fast evaluation of the phase diagrams.
